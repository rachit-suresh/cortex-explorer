# Cortex Explorer

> Interactive Interest Graph Explorer with a Neo-Brutalist aesthetic.

**Cortex** is a visual engine for exploring personal interest topologies. It replaces standard list-based UI with an interactive, directed graph. Built on the VITE stack, it utilizes a custom recursive layout algorithm to map relationships between domains (e.g., Sports -> Racing -> F1).

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Mind Map**: Visualizes interests using a structured tree layout (powered by `d3-hierarchy` and `reactflow`).
- **Neo-Brutalist Design**: High-contrast UI with bold borders, hard shadows, and vibrant colors.
- **Category Explorer**: A tactile grid interface for selecting and discovering new interests.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Suggests new topics based on your selected interest graph.
- **Custom Layout Algorithm**: Recursively maps hierarchical relationships for a clean, orthogonal graph view.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Visualization**: React Flow, d3-hierarchy
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Custom Neo-Brutalist Config)
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Cortex moves away from sterile, list-based interfaces. It embraces **Neo-Brutalism**—characterized by:

- **Bold Typography**: Uppercase, heavy weights.
- **High Contrast**: Thick black borders (`4px`) and hard drop shadows.
- **Vibrant Palette**: Unapologetic use of Cyan, Pink, Lime, and Yellow.
